## Section 1: Problem Diagnosis and Root Cause Analysis

### Current Challenges in Performance Management for AI Teams

#### 1. Misalignment Between Traditional KPIs and AI Work Characteristics

Traditional performance systems rely on clear, predictable outputs and timelines. However, AI work is fundamentally different:

- **Research-oriented roles** (AI Researchers, ML Scientists) focus on experimentation, publication, and novel algorithms—where failure is part of the process and timelines are uncertain
- **Engineering-oriented roles** (ML Engineers, MLOps) focus on productionization, reliability, and scalability—where predictability matters
- **Applied roles** (Data Scientists, Applied Scientists) bridge both worlds—requiring innovation metrics AND business impact

**External Research Support:**
- Studies show AI researchers in industry are evaluated differently than in academia, with **academic qualification being the primary factor** rather than just publication count
- The gap between academic research metrics (publications, citations) and industry needs (product impact, business value) creates tension

#### 2. Innovation vs. Accountability Dilemma

Traditional performance management emphasizes:
- Predictable goal achievement
- Clear quarterly targets
- Individual accountability

AI teams need:
- Psychological safety to experiment and fail
- Time for exploration and learning
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Long-term investment in capabilities

**External Research Support:**
- Google's [OKR system](https://rework.withgoogle.com/intl/en/guides/set-goals-with-okrs) balances ambition with achievability by setting "stretch goals" (70% achievement target)
- McKinsey research on radical change emphasizes that traditional change tools don't work for complex transformations

#### 3. One-Size-Fits-All Evaluation

AI roles span a continuum from pure research to pure engineering. A single evaluation framework creates:
- Researchers feeling pressured to deliver short-term business results
- Engineers feeling undervalued compared to "innovators"
- Applied scientists caught between conflicting expectations

**External Research Support:**
- The [AI Roles Continuum](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06087v1) research shows boundaries between AI roles are blurring, requiring differentiated evaluation
- [Valohai's analysis](https://valohai.com/blog/machine-learning-researcher-vs-engineers-difference/) highlights how ML researchers and engineers have fundamentally different success metrics

### Root Cause Hypotheses

Based on the research, I propose three root cause hypotheses to validate:

**Hypothesis 1:** The current performance system was designed for traditional engineering/business roles, not accounting for the experimentation-driven nature of AI work

**Hypothesis 2:** There is no differentiation framework for different AI role types (research vs. engineering vs. applied), causing misaligned expectations

**Hypothesis 3:** Performance conversations focus on short-term outputs rather than long-term capabilities and business impact

---

## Section 2: Intervention Design

Based on the diagnosis, I propose **4 core interventions** to transform your performance management system for AI teams.

### Intervention 1: Differentiated Role-Based Evaluation Framework

**Objective:** Create tailored evaluation criteria for different AI role types

**Design:**

| **Role Type** | **Primary Focus** | **Key Metrics** | **Example KRs** |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **AI Researcher** | Innovation & Knowledge Creation | • Publications in top venues<br>• Citations & influence<br>• Patent filings<br>• Open-source contributions | • Publish 2 papers at A* venues<br>• Achieve 500+ citations<br>• Deliver 1 patentable innovation |
| **ML Engineer** | Productionization & Reliability | • Model uptime & performance<br>• Deployment success rate<br>• System reliability<br>• Engineering best practices | • Maintain 99.9% model uptime<br>• Deploy 5 models to production<br>• Reduce inference latency by 30% |
| **Applied Scientist** | Business Impact & Innovation Balance | • Model business impact (revenue/savings)<br>• Model performance & adoption<br>• Cross-functional collaboration<br>• Technical contributions | • Drive $X revenue from ML models<br>• Achieve 80%+ model adoption<br>• Publish 1 applied research paper |
| **Data Scientist** | Insight Generation & Enablement | • Actionable insights delivered<br>• Dashboard/adoption rates<br>• Stakeholder satisfaction<br>• Data quality improvements | • Deliver 20 quarterly insights<br>• Achieve 90% stakeholder satisfaction<br>• Reduce data errors by 50% |

**Implementation:**
- Conduct role calibration workshops with AI team leads to validate categories
- Create role-specific OKR templates for each type
- Document evaluation rubrics with clear examples

**Responsible:** HRD + AI Team Leads
**Timeline:** Month 1-2

**Industry Case Reference:**
- [Google's OKR system](https://rework.withgoogle.com/intl/en/guides/set-goals-with-okrs) uses differentiated goals for engineering vs. research teams
- [Valohai's research](https://valohai.ai/blog/machine-learning-researcher-vs-engineers-difference/) emphasizes how role clarity improves performance

---

### Intervention 2: OKR System with AI-Adapted Goal Setting

**Objective:** Implement OKRs that balance ambition with achievability for AI work

**Design Principles:**

#### 1. Multi-Dimensional Goal Structure

Each AI employee sets 3 types of goals:

**Type A: Business Impact OKRs (40% weight)**
- Direct business outcomes (revenue, cost savings, efficiency)
- Measurable quarterly results

**Type B: Innovation/Learning OKRs (30% weight)**
- Research publications, patents, novel approaches
- Experimentation with new technologies
- Knowledge sharing (internal tech talks, documentation)

**Type C: Operational Excellence OKRs (30% weight)**
- Code quality, system reliability
- Process improvements, tooling
- Collaboration and mentorship

#### 2. Experimentation Allowance

- For Research/Applied roles: Allocate 20% time for exploratory work without immediate business impact requirements
- Document experiments and learnings, even failed ones contribute to performance evaluation

#### 3. Stretch Goals Philosophy

- Set ambitious goals with 70% achievement target (Google's approach)
- Missing stretch goals is not failure—it's part of innovation
- Distinguish between "stretch goals" (ambitious) vs. "committed goals" (must-achieve)

**Implementation:**
- Train AI managers on writing OKRs for different role types
- Create OKR template library with examples for each AI role
- Establish quarterly OKR review cycles

**Responsible:** HRD + L&D Team + External Consultant (optional)
**Timeline:** Month 2 (pilot), Month 3 (full rollout)

**Industry Case Reference:**
- [Google's OKR implementation](https://certiprof.com/blogs/news/okr-implementation-google) drove 10x performance improvement through stretch goals
- [Atlan's 2025 KPI guide](https://atlan.com/kpis-for-data-team/) shows how data teams balance technical and business metrics

---

### Intervention 3: Phased Rollout with Change Management

**Objective:** Ensure high adoption and minimize resistance through thoughtful change management

**Design - 3-Phase Rollout:**

  - 2-3 AI team leads (representing different role types)
  - 2-3 high-performing AI individual contributors
  - HRD + HRBP
  - 1-2 business leaders
- Conduct 3 co-creation workshops:
  - Workshop 1: Pain points & success criteria
  - Workshop 2: Design evaluation framework & OKR templates
  - Workshop 3: Review & refine, plan rollout
- Create "Early Adopter" program: 20-30 AI employees pilot in Month 2

#### Phase 2: Pilot & Learn (Month 2) - "Test & Adapt"

- Pilot with Early Adopters (1-2 AI teams)
- Run one OKR cycle with new framework
- Collect rapid feedback:
  - Weekly pulse surveys
  - Mid-point focus groups
  - End-of-cycle retrospective
- Iterate based on feedback

#### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Month 3) - "Scale & Support"

- Launch to all AI teams
- Provide intensive support:
  - Office hours with HRBP
  - OKR writing clinics
  - Manager training on new evaluation approach
- Celebrate early wins publicly

**Implementation:**
- Appoint a Change Champion from AI team (not HR) to lead communication
- Create FAQ document addressing common concerns
- Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement

**Responsible:** HRD + Design Committee + Change Champion
**Timeline:** Month 1-3 (phased approach)

**Industry Case Reference:**
- [Atlassian's IT change management best practices](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/change-management/best-practices) emphasize stakeholder involvement and incremental releases
- [McKinsey's radical change research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/change-is-changing-how-to-meet-the-challenge-of-radical-reinvention) shows traditional top-down change fails for complex transformations
