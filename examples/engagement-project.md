## Step 2: Solution Design

**SuperHROD Conducts Internal and External Information Gathering:**

Internal queries:
- Searching for historical similar projects...
- Querying best practices repository...

External search (MCP):
- "Employee engagement improvement tech company 2024"
- "Gallup engagement management communication"
- "Google Project Oxygen management behaviors"

**SuperHROD Presents Solution in Segments:**

### Segment 1: Problem Diagnosis and Root Cause Analysis

> Based on your description and survey data, the root causes of engagement decline in the Technology Department may include:
>
> 1. **Insufficient Management Communication** - Technical leaders lack management skills, communication frequency and quality are inadequate
> 2. **Excessive Workload** - Technical team is under high pressure and lacks support
> 3. **Unclear Career Development Paths** - Engineers cannot see growth trajectories
>
> **External Research Support:**
> - Gallup 2024 Study: Relationship with managers is the #1 driver of engagement (40% impact)
> - Google Project Oxygen: Regular feedback and communication is one of the top 8 behaviors of effective managers
>
> Recommendation for in-depth diagnosis: Focus group interviews (10-15 people) + supplementary questionnaire
>
> **Does this part look acceptable? Any adjustments needed?**

User: Looks good, continue.

### Segment 2: Intervention Design

> Based on root cause analysis, design 3 core interventions:
>
> **Intervention 1: Technical Leader Management Capability Enhancement**
> - Content: Coaching skills, feedback techniques, one-on-one meetings
> - Format: 2-day workshop + monthly practice salon
> - Target: 20 technical leads
>
> **Industry Case References:**
> - Google: Internal manager training program emphasizing "be a coach, not a boss"
> - Alibaba: "Management Three Axes" training covering all managers
>
> **Localization Adjustments:**
> - Considering the technical team's busy schedule, adopt lightweight 2-hour monthly salons
> - Provide ready-to-use one-on-one meeting templates to lower usage barriers
>
> **Intervention 2: Regular One-on-One Meeting Mechanism**
> - Content: Managers conduct 30-minute one-on-one communication with subordinates monthly
> - Assurance: Provide meeting templates and training, HR tracks execution rate
>
> **Intervention 3: Work Optimization and Support**
> - Content: Prioritize work, reduce low-value tasks; increase personnel support
>
> **Is this part acceptable?**

User: Good, what about the third segment?
